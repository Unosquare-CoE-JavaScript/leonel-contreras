    <h1>Syncronous vs Asyncronus</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Syncronous code</h2>
        <p> 
            Are codes that execute line to line, in orden to execute the next line, needs to finisih the prevous one.
            When a process is very complex could take a lot of time to finish, blocking other processes, this mean 
            you can´t doing anything else unitl the process end, we called this blocking code.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Asyncronus code</h2>
        <p>
            Are codes that don´t need to wait to previous lines finish to execute the new ones, when we use Asyncronus we
            know that in some point in the time we'll get a response but we don´t know when, this kind of code it´s called
          |  no-blocking code, the most of the time in JS we prefer to use it, but may exist some exceptions for example
            maybe we want to wait and don´t do anything else until user response.
        </p>

        <h2>Advantages and disadvantages</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Synchronous code</h3>
            <li>
                <ul>Advantage: Easy to write and to reason about it</ul>
                <ul>Disadvantage: May create blocking code</ul>
                <ul>Disadvantage: Less performance</ul>
            </li>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Asynchronus code</h3>
            <li>
                <ul>Advantage: very performant</ul>
                <ul>Advantage: Eliminates code blocking</ul>
                <ul>Disadvantage: It can be difficult to reason about</ul>
                <ul>Disadvantage: Harder to write</ul>
