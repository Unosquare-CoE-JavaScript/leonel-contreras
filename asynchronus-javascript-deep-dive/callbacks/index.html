    <h1>Callbacks</h1>
    <p>
        Callbacks are the traditionally way to implement async code
        in JS and avoid blocking code. <br>
        A callback is just a simple function that is execute when something
        happend. <br>
    </p>

    <h2>How callbacks are possible?</h2>
    <p>
        In javascript exist objects we can define it, but also variables are object
        and maybe the most wear situation it´s that functions also are objects,
        this is very important in JS 'cause allow you to pass function to another
        functions (A function that receives another function trough param it´s called
        higher order function), and this allows you to execute a function inside another 
        function. 
    </p>
    <H2>Examples</H2>
    <p>
        A very basic example of callbacks are events, for example listen for a click
        in some button, we attach some function to the click event, and when click happend
        we execute it.
    </p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Callback hell</li>
            <li>Difficult to reason about</li>
            <li>Inversion of control</li>
        </ul>
