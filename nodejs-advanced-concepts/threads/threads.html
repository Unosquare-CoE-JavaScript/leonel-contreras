    Thread

  <p>
    When we run programs in our computer we start something called process. A process is
    an instant of the computer program that is been executed a process could have
    one or more threads you can see a thread like a little to do list with a some numbers
    of instructions that need to be executed by the cpu.
    To decide what thread been executed the operating system had scheduler. Scheduler it´s 
    responsable to ensure that urgent threads are executed and all the threads don´t wait
    to much to be resolved.

  <h2>
    1.1. How to improve thread execution?
  </h2>
      - Adding more cpus core: if you had more than one core you can process differents threads at the same time
      technically one core can process more than one thread through multi-threading tecniques.
      - Examing the work that threads are doing: For example when one thread it´s waiting for some like accesing to the HD,
      like this operation is very slow, the scheduler can decide to pause this thread and execute others meanwhile.
