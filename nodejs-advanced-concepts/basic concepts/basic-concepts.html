      Nodejs: Basic concepts
    </h1>
    <p>
      In this section we will talk about the basics of nodejs, how it works,
      how it was developed, and specifics of event loop and the releated libraries
      like libuv.
    </p>
    <h2>
      1.1. What is Node?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nodejs is an environment to run JS code, it's multi purpose that means you can build
      web applications, batch processes, APIs, tools, and much more.
    </p>
    <h2>
      1.2. How NodeJS woks?
    </h2>
    <p>
      NodeJS is build in Javascript and C++, and use 2 principal elements that allows you
      to run JS code in basically any environment (Thanks c++) V8 and libuv.
    </p>
    <h2> 
      1.2.1. V8
    </h2>
    <p>
      Is the JS engine (interpret and run js code) that it´s used in nodeJS, and it was build by google.
    </p>
    <h2>
     1.2.2. Libuv
    </h2>
    <p>
      Is used for accesing the filesystem and control some aspects around concurrency.
    </p>
    <h2>
      1.3. How NodeJS run JS Code
    </h2>
    <p>
      All the code that we wrote in nodejs it happend in the JS Side for example when we import a library,
      frequenly this side just do some validation and very simple things but this side used a very interesting
      method process.binding that links a function in the C++ side with the JS side, this likend function (c++)
      is where things happends is here where you can find the logic to solve things, but how can interpret JS side
      or control the async aspects or concurrency, well to do this used v8 and libuv, v8 act as intermediary allowing
      values that are defined in JS side to be translated into the c++ equivalence, and libuv it´s use to allowed concurrency
      and procesing construct iny c++ side.
